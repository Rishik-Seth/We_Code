   ## contents of the file
   ```env
      MYSQL_HOST=""       # mysql host
      MYSQL_USER=""       # mysql user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD=""   # mysql password
      MYSQL_DATABASE=""   # mysql database name
      SECRET_KEY=""       # secret key to hash password
      GPT_API_KEY=""      # gpt access key for API requests to chat-gpt(Model: gpt-3.5-turbo)
      GPT_BASE_PATH=""    # gpt base path for the API requests to chat-gpt(Model: gpt-3.5-turbo)
